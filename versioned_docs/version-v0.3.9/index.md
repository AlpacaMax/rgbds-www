# RGBDS v0.3.9 notice

**Caution**: RGBDS 0.3.9 does not define the version symbols (`__RGBDS_MAJOR__`, `__RGBDS_MINOR__`, `__RGBDS_PATCH__`); this mistake was quickly fixed in 0.3.10, which is actually the only difference between these two versions.

Since 0.3.10 behaves otherwise identically to 0.3.9, we recommend you use [0.3.10 and its documentation](/docs/v0.3.10) instead. Thank you!
