# Introduction

RGBDS is the #1 toolchain for developing homebrew Game Boy programs. It’s composed of these four programs:

- RGBASM: the assembler
- RGBLINK: the linker
- RGBFIX: the header “fixer”
- RGBGFX: the image converter

Additional documentation is available:

- General information about RGBDS
- RGBASM language
- Game Boy ASM reference
- RGBLINK linker scripts
- RGBDS object file format
- [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/), the most comprehensive technical reference to Game Boy.

(All of this documentation is usually provided as man pages when installing RGBDS.)

All of the above links point to the most recent release’s documentation; however, we keep an archive of other versions’ docs. Additionally, the FAQ can help you resolve common problems.

## Releases & downloads

Releases can be found on GitHub, including pre-built Windows binaries. Please refer to our installation instructions for details, and for instructions for other platforms.

### Source code

All of RGBDS is open-source: the source code is on GitHub, and under the MIT license. This website’s source is on GitHub as well! Contributions to both are welcome.

## Acknowledgements

RGBDS would not be much without its users: the GB dev community.

Thank you to Carsten Sørensen (history), original creator of what would become RGBDS, and to all the contributors that carried the project since then!
