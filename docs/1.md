# GBZ80(7) - Miscellaneous Information Manual

# NAME

**gbz80** - CPU opcode reference

# DESCRIPTION

This is the list of opcodes supported by
rgbasm(1),
including a short description, the number of bytes needed to encode them and the number of CPU cycles at 1MHz (or 2MHz in GBC dual speed mode) needed to complete them.

Note: All arithmetic/logic operations that use register
**A**
as destination can omit the destination as it is assumed to be register
**A**
by default.
The following two lines have the same effect:

	OR A,B
	OR B
